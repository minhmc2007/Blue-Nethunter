# Blue NetHunter

**Blue NetHunter** is a Work-in-Progress (WIP) project based on [Offensive Security's Kali NetHunter](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-mobile). It aims to reimagine NetHunter with a fresh Blue Archive-inspired aesthetic while maintaining the powerful tools and customization that NetHunter offers.

> **DISCLAIMER:** This project is in a **very early development stage**. It is currently **not production-ready** and only includes two components.

## Current Status

Blue NetHunter is under active development. At the moment, only two apps are partially available:

- **NetHunter App** – The main application interface (WIP)
- **NetHunter Terminal** – A terminal emulator for interacting with Kali Linux environments (WIP)

These components are based entirely on the open-source code from the official [Kali NetHunter repository](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter).

## Features (Planned)

- A Blue Archive-themed UI and animations
- Integrated environment manager
- Full Blue NetHunter image build with Kali rootfs

## Installation

> **Note:** This is NOT ready for daily use or serious penetration testing. Install at your own risk.

You may manually build and install the two current apps:

1. Clone the NetHunter sources from [Offensive Security](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter).
2. Modify the theme and package name as needed.
3. Compile using Android Studio or Gradle CLI.

More detailed installation instructions will be provided in future releases.

## Credits
