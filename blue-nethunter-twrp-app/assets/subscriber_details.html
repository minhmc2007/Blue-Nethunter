<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Subscribers are able 
to download TWRP recovery images directly within the app instead of 
downloading through a web browser. Once the file is downloaded, the TWRP 
app automatically checks the hash of the downloaded file to ensure that 
the file was downloaded correctly and completely. If you have enabled 
root permissions, you will be able to flash the downloaded recovery 
image without having to browse to and select the file on supported 
devices. Additional subscriber benefits may be added in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>Ways To Become A Subscriber</B></SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US">There are two ways 
to become a subscriber. You may enable the network statistics feature of 
the app which involves a small amount of anonymous data collection 
related to network performance. The network statistics subscriber method 
is free and never expires (see terms and conditions for more details). Alternatively, you 
may subscribe via Google Play for 1 year for a small donation to help 
offset our costs of hosting the recovery images.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>NOTE: Do not buy a subscription if your device is not currently supported! Purchasing a subscription is not a way to purchase support for your device!</B></SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>We may have to end support for any device at any time. Your subscription is a donation for our past efforts, not a payment for future support. Subscribers do not receive any additional support for problems you may encounter when using TWRP.</B></SPAN></P>
